# Assignment 1 - DECIDE

This repository contains the source code, unit tests, build files and documentation for the DECIDE mini project (assignment 1 for DD2480).

## DECIDE

This program is part of a hypothetical anti-ballistic missile system. It determines whether to issue a launch signal based on radar data.

## Building and testing

The project uses Gradle to build and test the program. The unit tests are implemented with JUnit. DECIDE can be built and tested with the following commands:

1. `gradle wrapper`
2. `./gradle build`

## Running the program

The main DECIDE program reads a DECIDE instance from stdin. The first 19 lines of standard input represents the scalar parameters defined in the requirements specification: `LENGTH1`, `RADIUS1`, ..., `AREA2`. The next 15 lines are each 15 numbers from {0=NOTUSED, 1=ORR, 2=ANDD} that represents the LCM. The next line is 15 values from {true, false} representing the PUV. The next line is an integer N with the number of radar data points, and the next N lines are pairs of doubles representing the `x` and `y` coordinates of each point. There is an example input file under `app/input`. On Linux, you can run the main DECIDE method with an input file using the following command: 
`java -classpath app/bin/main decide.Decide < [path-to-input-file]`

## Generating documentation

1. From the base directory, execute `javadoc -d doc -sourcepath app/src/main/java decide`

## Way of working assessment

Based on our assessment, we are in the `Working well` stage of the way of working-checklist. We have a well defined workflow with regards to working on this small software project. The tools and practices are typical of collaborative software development. The main repository is hosted on GitHub and we continually build on the project by creating issues describing atomic additions and modifications, working on branches connected to an issue, and finally by merging the branch into the main trunk. The tools and practices are utilized by each team member and the project been developing smoothly. This workflow was already familiar to the members of the team, and the members have been able to follow it with little issue or conflict. The main obstacle to reach the `Retired` state is completing the project and reflecting on the project in order to draw lessons for future projects.
